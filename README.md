# JS project:  3D Maze project
This project is a JavaScript project for Brightcode course.


## Project steps:
- Part 1: Creating an architecture of project and console view
- Part 2: Implementing maze generation algorithms
- Part 3: Creating search algorithms and adapting maze to be searchable
- Part 4: Creating UI (Undone)


## Lessons learned and difficulties in implementing

This project was truly hard and interesting. I was so involved in algorithms and trying to make code and structure better that I forgot about GUI. 
I've learned how to use OOP in JavaScript better. Also I really understood basic graphs and its traversals, how different algorithms move from node to node.
Difficult for me was to create GUI, as this is very unpleasant in vanilla JS. And I forgot about the game aspect of the project at all, but I hope that I'll do it in the next couple of days. 

I really appreciate all the materials that were during lectures and additional materials. It's really great that there are few things to search for by myself. I hope that the next project will teach me more about the GUI part of JavaScript.

Time spended on this project is priceless.
